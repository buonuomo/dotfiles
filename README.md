## Dotfiles ##

These are my core dotfiles for my terminal setup

### Installation ###

Simply clone this repository into your home directory and run the setup script
```
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/buonuomo/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
Note that if you already have a dotfile with the same name in your home
directory, the setup script will skip that one, and you will have to link or
copy it manually.
